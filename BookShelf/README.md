# BookShelf
===========

http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/bookshelf/

What is it for?
---------------
This plugin allows players to store books - whether they be Signed, Unsigned, or just plain old Books - in those once useless bookshelves. This plugin encourages players to write books and store them in shelves. Book Shelves are opened like a chest, by right clicking on the shelf. This opens a chest-like inventory that only allows the storage of Books. The books are stored in a SQLite database, so no setup is required. :)
